  <Overview>
    Telerik was founded in 2002 by four graduates of American University in Bulgaria and Technical University of Sofia. Initially focused on 
    providing outsourced software development for foreign and Bulgarian companies,[5] the company shifted its direction to the creation of 
    application development tools. Its first product, RAD editor (rapid application development),[6] was a web page editor designed to support the 
    then recently launched Microsoft technology, ASP.NET. The company then expanded its offerings to include user interface (UI) navigation controls, 
    and the Telerik Sitefinity content management system a few years later.[7]
    Based upon developer interaction, Telerik developed tools targeted to support other .NET technologies, such as ASP.NET AJAX, ASP.NET MVC, WPF, Silverlight and Windows/Windows Phone.[8] Telerik introduced support for HTML5 and JavaScript in 2011 with its Kendo UI product,[9] coinciding with expected industry growth in mobile adoption.[10]
